# SilverRail TechThis is a repo for managing machine readable artifacts for the [SilverRail Tech APIs](http://ww1.jeppesen.com/main/corporate/land/journey-planning/index.jsp). The goal is to maintain and evolve an OpenAPI, Postman Collection, and APIs.json index for the [SilverRail Tech APIs](http://ww1.jeppesen.com/main/corporate/land/journey-planning/index.jsp).They are a constant work in progress, and will be updated on a regular basis when new information is added, or more of the specifications are supported.Feel free to submit a pull request to evolve any of the artifacts, and leave GitHub issues if you have any questions, comments, or feedback.- [Website](http://ww1.jeppesen.com/main/corporate/land/journey-planning/index.jsp)- [Developer](http://ww1.jeppesen.com/main/corporate/land/journey-planning/index.jsp)- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/silverrailtech)The [APIs.json](https://github.com/api-evangelist/silverrail-tech/blob/master/apis.json) index provides links to all the relevant links for the SilverRail Tech APIs, including the OpenAPI and Postman if they are present.
